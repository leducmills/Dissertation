\chapter{Selected Transcriptions}

This appendix contains several illustrative transcriptions from the third user
study with the PopCAD and SnapCAD, where we recorded the speech and gesture
expressions of users explaining their modeling strategy. These excerpts contain
quotes from users generated while explaining their modeling strategy for a given
shape, the observed gestures that occurred during the spoken explanation, and
the speech and gesture codes generated from those expressions. A reminder of the
codes and examples used are provided in Table \ref{GcodingStrategy}.

\emph{Excerpt 1}

\begin{quotation}
``It goes upward, downward, over, up,across, over downward, over, and doesn't
go up again."
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (Pointing along sides of the shape)\\
Codes: S.M, G.PF \\ 
- User3, Shape P2, Session 1\\


\emph{Excerpt 2}

\begin{quotation}
``I saw that is was a series of L shapes\ldots I just thought that if I
could make a series of L, I could soon make it." 
\end{quotation} 
Gesture: (rotating model in hand repeatedly)\\
Codes: S.PW, S.PF, G.V\\ 
- User 4, Shape P2, Session 1\\

\emph{Excerpt 3}

\begin{quotation}
``Well it's based on the points, so the shape has 6 points, so needed 5
towers for the 6 points\ldots because of how to works you get one point there, you go
down, then another point, then you go over, on the same kind of layer\ldots and
then in the middle, so you don't just have a flat square, and you're pulling it up, you get
two points, so it is pulling the whole thing."
\end{quotation} 
Gesture: (pulls ``up'' with hands, points to towers, makes flat hand for
layers)\\
Codes: S.PW, S.PF, S.M, S.O, G.PF, G.O, G.M\\ 
- User 11, Shape CH1, Session 1\\

\emph{Excerpt 4}

\begin{quotation}
``Because the lines are the same way, as, the, uh, that shape."
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (shrugs)\\
Codes: S.V, G.V\\ 
- User 8, Shape P2, Session 1\\

\emph{Excerpt 5}

\begin{quotation}
``By taking each point, each side, and creating it into a point on the
graph" "on this shape, uh, this is about, uh 3 points wide, and 2 points tall, like, on
this, and then also, like 2 points out."
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (at `like this' points to two lights on the device one after the
other.)\\
Codes: S.O, S.PF, G.PF \\
- User 7, Shape T2, Session 1\\

\emph{Excerpt 6}

\begin{quotation}
``If it was hull then I knew it would automatically connect and fill in between
the points, so all I really needed to do was make two triangles, and it would
fill in the rest" 
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (gestures with hands to indicate two parts moving together)\\
Codes: S.O, S.PF, G.M, G.PF\\
- User 11, Shape CH1, Session 2\\

\emph{Excerpt 7}

\begin{quotation}
``Because, it didn't look like a pyramid, but like a right pyramid\ldots like a
right angle, one side is a right\ldots I put four there, in each corner\ldots I
put one on top because it was the point, a vertex\ldots and then I looked at the laptop and it
looked like the shape." 
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (points to different corners of the shape) \\
Codes: S.PW, S.PF, S.O, G.PF, G.V\\
- User 17, Shape CH4, Session 2\\

\emph{Excerpt 8}

\begin{quotation}
``When I was trying to make this part, I was trying to make it small, from the
middle\ldots I made it look like it's supposed to look, I made it down,
straight, up, right, down, straight, up\ldots so I try to just mimic the shape
and see how it works."
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (gestures along the path on the device that the user is describing)\\
Codes: S.PF, S.PW, S.M, G.M, G.PF\\
- User 1, Shape T3, Session 2\\

\emph{Excerpt 9}

\begin{quotation}
``There's two U's, and um, like an entrance to a doorway."
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (traces with finger along different parts of the shape)\\
Codes: S.PF, S.O, G.PF\\
- User 5, Shape T3, Session 1\\

\emph{Excerpt 10}

\begin{quotation}
``Basically drawing it out with my mind." 
\end{quotation}
Gesture: (makes drawing motion with hand, then a sort of vague waving motion)\\
Codes:  S.O, S.V, G.M, G.V\\
- User 2, Shape P3, Session 2\\
