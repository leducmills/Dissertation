% - Great work overall
% - Why did you display the statistics the way you did?
%      - Perhaps add error bars to the graphs
% - Add transcriptions from the interactions and describe them in detail
%      - Perhaps send link to video
%      - (Mike) Put it into an Appendix so you don't break the flow of the presentation of the dissertation
% - Tools make a big difference, imagine child programming without Logo or Scratch
%      - But that's not really the focus of the paper
%      - Add a focus on the design of tools
% - Don't stop working in this area
% 
% 
% Kylie
% - Dissertation does 2 things
%      - Adds design and shifts the landscape of tools
%      - Embraces idea of testing and thinking of malleable questions that the tools might pose
% - Most campuses have a statistical consulting office, they're very helpful
%      - (Jeff) Perhaps: http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/crs/statcons.html
% - Talk about second half, contribution to research literature
%      - Where do you see yourself publishing?
%      - Could be a learning sciences contribution
%      - (Ben) Not fond of CHI. IDC, TEI, ICLS
%      - (Mike) TOCHI
%      - (Paulo) IJCCI
% - The gender data is too close and the sample is too small
%      - Don't make a mountain out of mole hill
% - Like classifying the complexity of 3D objects
% - What do you see your work doing to extend the speech and gesturing landscape?
%      - (Ben) Not about extending the landscape, more about seeing if it existed. See if design can impact gesturing
%      - Being too modest
%      - 3d modeling, learning and growth over time, articulate the contribution of the core questions that the study has asked
%      - 2-3 papers of the design work and how the design allows you to ask interesting questions
% - Fluidity between the construction and the modeling / 2d presentation. What affordances does that have?
%      - (Ben) 2d/3d fluidity in the paper
%      - The distance between media can really cement learning
% 
% 
% C-Dawg
% - Second some of the statistics comments
% - Leave some of the smaller differences alone, i.e. gender variations
% - Another stats point, people started w, s, or p then switched, so there's a fairly standard analyzes you can try to assess differences in s vs. p and order effects. There's a graphical way to display the data that may suggest this.
% - Modeling question
%      - (Ben) Modeled in the first session
%      - Didn't show which they made with different tool, if you separated that, would there be an obvious difference in what they made?
%      - (Ben) With the simpler shapes, they could have made them with either devices. With the more abstract ones, it matters
% - What can you say of the cost of the modeling device?
%      - (Ben) Not a whole lot: construction paper, conductive tape, led's, micro controller, time, xacto knife
%      - This might be an aspect of the work you're pursuing, sounds like it's an affordable option, that's pretty cool.
%      - (Ben) Want to make the designs as sturdy as possible and make them an open source project
% - Did you record the sessions, can review and see if there was difference between the snap device
%      - Review number of vertices, etc
% - What would be involved in making the pop-device out of wood? Balsa wood
%      - (Ben) Doesn't necessarily have to have any paper engineering
% - Interesting work!
% 
% 
% Tom Yeh
% - Having kids work in groups was nice, did you observe any group dynamics with pop-cad? Any anecdotal observations of what kids do together?
%      - (Ben) Observed interesting dynamics, one controls device, one controls software, turn-taking
%      - One advantage is the tangible nature and allowing multiple people to work together, traditional 3d modeling software can't do this
% - Is there accessible 3d modeling software, can blind kids use this?
%      - (Ben) Talked to Amy and Shaun Kane, not the major thrust, but it's possible
%      - What would you say to people that would want to adapt your device? What advice would you give?
%      - (Ben) Need a way to differentiate which axis, which point in space they're dealing with. Audio feedback
%      - How would you replace the light?
%      - (Ben) Multiple vibrations of a singular column, with dampening material
% - I'm a teacher in a high school, how do I start?
%      - (Ben) Design a sturdier open-source version
%      - Could it come as a kit?
%      - (Ben) Yes, but the cost may be more than it's worth
% 
% 
% Mike Eisenberg
% - Thesis notes in particular
% - Wanted to see more of a description of the free-hand modeling, that's a success, they were making stuff and playing with it
%      - Add what they said, what they were doing with it
%      - 2d writing device, kids were spontaneously were doing that, hadn't thought of that in those terms
% - Mentioned some initial credit to Julie Debiosie, 3d geo board is a stodgy instrument
%      - Not much of a mention of the promise for teaching
%      - Talk about it as a stodgy teaching device for x, y, z coordinates, maybe less free-wheeling but useful things people could do
% - You don't want to be the uCube guy or the pop-cad guy, you want to be the embodied interfaces guy
%      - What are these instances of?
%      - What can we learn about embodied interface design from this?
%      - What do we know now that we didn't know before?
%      - What would be inspired by this 5-10 years down the road?
%      - (Ben) Embodied fabrication device
% 
% Audience Questions
% - (Jeff) Why not switches for blind students?
% - (Jeff) What happens as the n-dimensions increase?
% - (Tom) Point and line becomes important in a high dimensional space. Kids are good at building in the minecraft world
% - (Ben) Could be interesting to have a minecraft mode

\abstract{  \OnePageChapter We present a class of devices under the umbrella
moniker of ``embodied fabrication''. These devices and the development of the
term embodied fabrication is rooted not only in computer science, but in
cognitive science, childhood educational theory, emerging digital fabrication
technology, and the convergence of these strands present in the do-it-yourself
community known as the ``maker movement''. As such, we operate under a certain
set of premises that guide and direct this work.
First, that embodied cognition - which places the body at the center of our
cognitive operations - provides a framework from which to ground our decisions
to design physical peripheral devices as opposed to purely screen-based
software. Second, that a strong line of pedagogical research supports providing
children with tangible, ``manipulative'' objects to learn with. Third, that
digital fabrication technologies - 3D printing in particular - provide a
wonderful new opportunity for children and novice designers in general to make,
play, and explore creatively - and that the current design options for 3D
printers are not suited to meaningful design and creation of objects by
non-expert 3D modelers. Finally, that by following the best traditions of
body-centric interaction design for children, devices can be created to provide
an educationally and technically rich environment that connects kids to the
creative potential of 3D printing. We unpack these ideas more in the
introduction, followed by an overview of three prototype devices belonging to
this class of ``embodied'' interfaces, a chapter on related work followed by a
chapter on the three user studies we performed with our devices, a discussion of
the presented studies, and finally we present a vision of the future of this
work and of embodied fabrication devices as a whole before concluding.

I was incredibly fortunate to have found the supporting cast that I did during
my studies. My advisor, Michael Eisenberg is one of the true gems of humanity.
An unbelievable scholar, gifted writer, and a wonderfully supportive and warm
person. Our conversations were always inspiring; may there be many more to come.
My father, for putting Mike on my radar as I was applying to grad school and for
always letting me know how proud you were. It meant a lot. You and I turned out
more alike than I ever would have imagined. My mom, for her unwavering faith
that I would be excellent. You were much better at convincing me than I was at
convincing myself. Your visits were always a chance to recharge my batteries,
feel loved, and be fed extremely well. Monika, for taking the risk of leaving
your world behind to join me in Colorado, and for supporting me so well during a
stressful time. You're the best cheerleader a guy could ask for. I'm a lucky
man. Many others supported this work, academically and socially. Credit goes to
Julie DiBiase, Yingdan Huang, and Kate Starbird for their early work on a
3DGeoboard. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Nathan Seidle, whose
generosity allowed this work to reach its completion. My committee members were
all amazingly insightful and supportive. Ann Eisenberg kept the lab from
self-destruction more times than I can count. Present and past CU students for
their support (especially Jeff and Swamy in CS and all the MFA kids). Lindsay
Levkoff Diamond, for being an incredibly understanding and flexible boss during
my studies. The DoE and all my friends at SparkFun Electronics - without you, I
don't know if I would have made it. Finally, the staff and students at Gold
Crown for their amazing support during my user study. Thank you all.}
