\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

Digital fabrication technologies are increasingly finding their way into
educational spaces of all shapes and sizes. These new technologies 
(3D printers, laser cutters, etc.) afford opportunities for exploring these new
ways of `making' and how they may change the way we learn, explore, and play.
Although there is much excitement surrounding the `maker movement' - and 3D
printing in particular - there has been little examination of how to introduce
a younger audience to 3D printing in an empowering way.
This proposal argues that tangible interfaces - as opposed to 2D screen-based
media - can be designed not only to support spatial reasoning and mathematical
intuitions in children by engaging them in exploratory modeling and play, but
that these interfaces can act as a democratizing force by enabling children to
create physical objects with digital fabrication devices.
The proposed work presents a series of novel tangible input devices for
enhancing mathematical and spatial reasoning in kids with a focus on generating
output for 3D printing.
We discuss related work, the status of the proposed work, additional
improvements to be made, a timeline for completion,
and a discussion of risks, limitations, and outcomes inherent in the proposal.
