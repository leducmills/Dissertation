The belief that tangible objects\footnote{It is worth noting the difference in
this work between `tangible objects' of the sort that a child might play with
(e.g. Lego) and `tangible user interfaces' (TUIs) that a child might interact
with - typically a peripheral device (apart from the keyboard and mouse) that
communicates physical interactions to a computer.} play an important role in
children's education is relatively recent. Friedrich Froebel's use of 20 wooden
forms he dubbed `gifts' in the first Kindergarten was in 1837\cite{froebel}. It
took until 1907 before an extension of Froebel's ideas and a focus on physical,
manipulative objects and tasks was implemented by Maria Montessori in the first
Casa Dei Bambini\cite{montessori}.
The interest in children's learning incorporating the use of manipulatives
progressed steadily, most notably by Jean Piaget and his work on `genetic
epistemology'. Piaget wrote extensively on the stages of development during
which certain kinds of knowledge emerged\cite{Piaget}, including
logical-mathematical knowledge related to the kind we wish to foster.
Additionally, by using our devices as an assessment vehicle for children's
spatial reasoning, one can position our work as part of a tradition (dating back
at least to Piaget \cite{piaget1967child}) in understanding spatial thinking and
its development (cf. also \cite{newcombe2003making} for a more recent treatment
of the subject). While Piaget's specific theories have been strongly
challenged\cite{Esther}\cite{Repacholi}, his influence was (and is!) extremely
important. Seymour Papert, one of Piaget's intellectual descendants, published
Mindstorms\cite{mindstorms} in 1980 and with it introduced his own ideas about
constructivism. Combined with the advent of the physical Logo turtle, Papert
brought many constructivist ideas into the modern age and opened the door for a
technical and cognitive exploration of how computation and interactive objects
could be combined to examine the link between tangibles and children's learning.

% It should also be noted, along these lines, that our early pilot test experience
% suggested a use for our work as an assessment vehicle for children's spatial
% cognition. We have, for instance, given children a pattern of lights
% and ask them to match that pattern to one of a set of physical or pictorial
% solid representations as well as ask children to recreate a variety of
% physical solids (such as a plastic prism or tetrahedron) by selecting the
% appropriate set of lights, and note their development and difficulties in doing
% so. By using the UCube as an experimental device in this fashion, one can
% position this work as part of a tradition (dating back at least to Piaget
% \cite{piaget1967child}) in understanding spatial thinking and its development
% (cf. also \cite{newcombe2003making} for a more recent treatment of the subject).

While a rich and diverse lineage of tangible and embedded user interfaces has
progressed since (and partially because of) Papert, the genealogy of the
proposed work derives from an interest not only in constructivist-like
activities, but in theories about how interaction with physical objects may be
beneficial to learning. In cognitive science, the area of embodied cognition
examines the ways in which our interactions with the physical world shape our
cognitive experiences from a body-centric point of view. More specifically,
embodied cognition holds that our cognitive processes are `deeply rooted in the
body's interactions with the world'\cite{Wilson}. This is in stark contrast to
decades of research in cognitive science wherein the mind was viewed as a sort
of central but detached information processing unit where motor-sensory
functions were more-or-less secondary inputs and outputs to a main
system\cite{clark1998being}.

Although there are several different tenets of this body-centric view, the
primary conclusion relevant to our proposal is that interactions with physical
objects can shape, clarify, and reinforce our cognitive processes in scores of
disparate areas. Of keen interest for this work in particular is a domain
referred to as embodied mathematics.
Lakoff and Nu\~nez\cite{lakoff} give a fascinating account of the origins of
mathematics from an embodied point of view. They propose that humans, by virtue
of their interactions with the physical world, inevitably form certain
intuitions of a mathematical nature. Recognizing small numbers of objects (e.g.
the pre-verbal ability to do arithmetic with less than five objects),
estimation, and simple comparisons are a few of the examples given
in\cite{lakoff}. From these basics, they argue that four kinds of physical
operations (object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and
movement along a path) form the basis of simple arithmetic. Although the book
postulates about concepts as ungrounded and seemingly abstract as infinity, for
our work it is enough to suggest that the interactions present in our designs
follow from these four operations and may in fact contribute to the
solidification of more complex mathematical ideas in 3D modeling and digital
fabrication (e.g. forming correct mental models of 3-dimensional objects). Such
notions of embodied mathematics have–even before the Lakoff/Nu\~nez text–played
a role in discussions of the development or instruction of mathematical ideas.
The link between physical experience and mathematical growth was a strong
element, for instance, in Montessori's work (see, e.g.,
\cite{hainstock1978essential}); much of the motivation behind traditional
mathematical ``manipulatives'' such as number rods and balance beams can also be
traced to this intellectual tradition. More recently, theoretical discussions of
embodied cognition have given rise to fine-grained observations of the
connections between bodily activity and mathematical learning:
Goldin-Meadow\cite{goldin2005hearing}, for instance, describes a fascinating
line of research in which children's nonverbal gestures appear to both reflect
and, in some cases, anticipate their verbal understanding of concepts such as
conservation and ``inverse operations''. In other work, Ehrlich, Levine and
Goldin-Meadow show that through an analysis of hand gestures, one is not only
able to predict a subject's `readiness' to learn mathematical
concepts\cite{goldin} but that the kinds of gestures children make (those
relating to movement, for example) are correlated with spatial reasoning
ability\cite{ehrlich2006importance} and performance on mental transformation
tasks.
 
Pedagogical research in embodied mathematics has, moreover, proceeded
hand-in-hand with the development of desktop, embedded, or portable
technological artifacts to support the link between bodily actions and
mathematical conceptualization. Papert's discussions of the Logo computer
language \cite{mindstorms} reveal this connection early in the history of
children's computing: Papert discussed, for example, the way in which the
program for a Logo circle resonated with children's bodily understanding of
moving in a circular path. More recently, Nemirovsky et al.
\cite{nemirovsky1998body} describe the use of a computer-based motion detector
system to assist children in the development of intuitions behind graphing;
Howison et al. \cite{howison2011mathematical} used a device based on a
Nintendo Wii remote to assess children's understanding of ratio (the children
attempt to move their arms in a manner illustrating a target ratio); Bakker et al.
\cite{bakker2011moso} created a collection of handheld objects (``MoSo
Tangibles'') with embedded sensors to help children learn about musical ideas
via hand motions such as waving, squeezing (pressing hands together), and
shaking up and down, among others; Mickelson and Ju \cite{mickelson2011math} use
sophisticated video and projection equipment as the basis of activities through
which children can learn about mathematical ideas (e.g., symmetry, rotation
angles) via large-scale physical movements.
 
In their section on `Thinking Through Doing', Klemmer et
al.\cite{Klemmer:2006:BMF:1142405.1142429} give a particularly poignant summary
of why we ought to consider the body as instrumental in any human-computer
interaction design, stepping through many of the concepts outlined above. In
fact, the marriage of ideas derived from Papert's work with the conclusions of
embodied cognition are not new, and appear to substantiate our motivations to
produce tangible, manipulative interfaces as opposed to purely 2-dimensional
screen-based work. In the mid-to-late 1990's, research examining the ways in
which physical objects might be infused with computational ability started to
coalesce around several themes\cite{Eisenberg:1996:RMV:257089.257230}. Resnick's
work with ``digital
manipulatives"\cite{Resnick:1998:DMN:274644.274684}\cite{Zuckerman:2005:ETI:1054972.1055093}
specifically references the contributions of Froebel and Montessori in the
design of a series of ``programmable bricks'' with computational ability whose aim
is to make certain specific concepts (e.g. systems-level thinking) more salient
for the user. Ishii's work on breaking down the divide between physical and
virtual worlds into `tangible
bits'\cite{Ishii:1997:TBT:258549.258715}\cite{Ishii:2008:TBB:1347390.1347392}
has subsequently set the stage for a new family of tangible interface designs
that support the kind of embodied interactions that our work seeks to produce.
By constructing environments and artifacts that focus on the possible physical
representations of computational components, these works (among others) created
the philosophical space to delve into how tangible objects might affect users at
a cognitive level. Our proposal is a confluence of both tangible and cognitive
design; as Resnick states, `We are interested in Things That Think only if they
also serve as Things To Think With'\cite{Resnick:1998:DMN:274644.274684}.

Having shown several PopCAD prototypes in Chapter 2 representative of a
``renaissance'' in papercrafting by infusing it with electronics, it is worth
situating that work in relation to that of other researchers in this (still
embryonic) field. The blending of traditional papercrafts with emerging
technology is in fact still a relatively novel technique, but there is a
remarkable community of researchers beginning to explore this area. For us, a
special debt is owed to Leah Buechley's High-Low Technology group at the MIT
Media Lab; that group first (to our knowledge) introduced conductive ink and
copper tape into paper-based projects. Early (c. 2008) use of conductive ink
with microcontrollers on a paper substrate can be found in
\cite{buechley2009paints} and \cite{Eisenberg:2009:CPR:1551788.1551790} with the
development of paper-based Arduino processors and simple electronic components
(e.g. LEDs, toy motors, switches) that could be placed onto conductive paint to
form an electronic connection. This work culminated with a paper application
usually reserved for home remodeling: a ``living wallpaper''\cite{Buechley2010}
where passers-by could trigger light, movement, and sound by interacting with
different parts of the surface (see Figure \ref{fig:paperCrafts}).

\begin{figure}[ht]

pop-up book infused with a variety of paper-friendly electronics. The Living
Wall (right) is a complete interactive environment embedded in wallpaper,
reacting with light, sound, and movement.}
\label{fig:paperCrafts}
\end{figure}


These early efforts in turn spawned developments that further refined the
expressive potential of paper-based electronics, infusing traditional
papercrafts with new elements and abilities. An electronic pop-up book by Qi and
Buechley\cite{Qi:2010:EPE:1709886.1709909} re-imagined the traditional pop-up by
infusing each page with paper-friendly, interactive circuitry (e.g. by using a
copper tape circuit to power LEDs in a pop-up cityscape), and from which PopCAD
certainly owes some debt. Other projects in this vein include techniques to
animate origami structures through shape-memory alloy (SMA)\cite{Qi2012}, using
SMAs in the design and fabrication of printable paper-based devices (e.g.
speakers and lamps)\cite{Saul2010a}, storytelling and craft-making through
electronically-enhanced storybooks and workshops
\cite{Jacoby2013a}\cite{Buechley2012}\cite{Sylla2012} and the use of small
microcontrollers incorporated into programmable paper-based
sculptures\cite{Mellis:2013:MMC:2460625.2460638}.

These efforts have focused on the creation of compelling(either electronically
or digitally enhanced) papercrafts. As noted in the introduction, there are
numerous technological developments that, in combination, serve to accelerate
the development of paper mechatronics. For instance, Kawahara et
al.\cite{Kawahara2013} describe how inkjet-ready conductive ink can allow
circuits to be printed easily and directly onto paper; and Koizumi et
al.\cite{Koizumi2010a} present a toolkit for wireless control of movable paper
toys, Zhu et al.\cite{Zhu2011a} describe a method for wireless power transfer
for paper computing, and Coelho et al.\cite{Coelho2009} have achieved the direct
embedding of conductive components during the papermaking process.

Of particular interest for the current work are explorations focusing on 3D
modeling and perception with tangible interfaces. Prime examples include
software that allows for 3D shapes to be flattened into paper-printable,
origami-esque polyhedra\cite{Eisenberg:1997:HUT:238218.238312}, a construction
kit with kinetic memory so as to record and playback certain user-generated
manipulations\cite{Raffle:2004:TCA:985692.985774}, as well as several variations
of ``smart-cube'' interfaces
\cite{Watanabe:2004:SAI:1037851.1037874}\cite{Schweikardt:2006:RRC:1180995.1181010}
that encourage spatial and logical reasoning in order to make use of the
computational aspects of the cubes. While diverse in their implementation, these
kits point to ways in which interface design can tease out the kind of
3-dimensional problem-solving and exploration present in the proposed work.

Related contributions focus more on the cognitive processes involved when
exploring embodied interfaces with children. Research on supporting creative
problem solving with children\cite{Bevans:2011:SCC:1979742.1979838}, arguing for
a kindergarten-influenced approach to creative
thinking\cite{Resnick:2007:IRN:1254960.1254961}, embodied approaches to
analyzing children's interactions with smart
objects\cite{Antle:2009:THE:1520340.1520612}, as well as the embodied design of
interfaces for introducing mathematical concepts to
kids\cite{Abrahamson:2011:TED:1999030.1999031} have shown a great degree of
correlation between physical interaction and learning in children.

\end{figure}

Yet so far, there have been few attempts to design embodied interfaces for
children that specifically address the growing presence and availability of
digital fabrication tools.
KidCAD\cite{Follmer:2012:KDR:2207676.2208403}, a deformable pad that captures
the 2.5D geometry of depressions made on the underside of the surface, was a
very promising idea in that it allowed very young children to take small objects
from their surroundings (or their hands) and `stamp' them into the pad - an
intuitive and satisfying experience. Unfortunately, the authors intentions to be
able to output the geometry to 3D printers has not yet manifested.
Easigami\cite{Huang:2012:EVC:2148131.2148143} is a set of interchangeable and
interlocking polyhedral faces with smart `hinges' that can reproduce the
morphology of a set of connected faces while connected to a computer. In
contrast, Easigami \emph{is} able to export this morphology to a
stereolithography file ready for 3D printing. There are several other interfaces
that deal with `interactive fabrication'\cite{Willis:2010:IFN:1935701.1935716};
devices that manipulate materials interactively based on various input from a
user, such as controlling a laser cutter with a laser pointer (instead of
through a CAD program)\cite{Mueller:2012:ICI:2380116.2380191}, or a wearable
device that takes in a CAD file and provides haptic feedback to make the
physical creation of the device by hand easier, even for a
non-fabricator\cite{Zoran:2013:FFD:2470654.2481361}.
These projects, as well as several others that deal specifically with digital
fabrication for laser
cutting\cite{Johnson:2012:SMS:2212776.2212390}\cite{Willis:2010:SSB:1709886.1709890},
are examples of the subset of tangible interfaces to which this work belongs -
namely, those concerned with providing a means to engage with digital
fabrication technologies in a more intuitive, embodied fashion. However, with
the exception of KidCAD and Easigami these designs are not made with children in
mind, nor do they cover the range of possibilities for child-friendly input
devices that focus on 3D-printing. Thus, we argue that there is room in this
area for the work described in the thesis, as well as a lineage that suggests
meaningful results may follow from continuing to explore the incorporation of
tangible interfaces with embodied design.

Specifically, we see our devices as part of a larger, burgeoning ``technological
ecosystem'' around the activity of three-dimensional printing. The introduction
chapter to this work noted several prominent researchers who argue for the
democratization of this technology, and for its applications to education.
Indeed, exciting early work has been done in applying 3D printing to education
in fields such as architecture \cite{breen2003tangible}, solid geometry
\cite{hart2008procedural}, and mechanical design \cite{lipson20053}.
Our devices are specifically designed so that they can be employed by younger
students – younger, for instance, than the typical (undergraduate-age)
architecture student - and certainly less skilled or experienced with
traditional 3D modeling software. The devices were created to enable children to
specify and identify three-dimensional shapes by hand motions (instead of, by
contrast, using symbolic commands directed at a two-dimensional screen display).
At the same time, they are not simply devices for mathematical instruction,
nor even a general tool for mathematical design - but as a suite of
experiential, embodied interfaces for engaging youth in a variety of spatial
design activities aimed not only at learning but at democratizing authorship
for 3D printing as well.

% from IDC 2011
% There are several strands of research that have strongly influenced the design
% (and motivation) for the UCube. Perhaps the most fundamental of these is in the
% area of "embodied mathematics"– that is, the notion that mathematical thinking
% and learning are affected by, and perhaps grounded in, metaphors derived from
% bodily experience. The most thorough and discursive (though largely theoretical)
% discussion of these ideas is in the foundational text by Lakoff and Nuñez
% \cite{lakoff}:
% the authors discuss physically-derived metaphors that underlie such essential
% mathematical ideas as numbers, operations, and sets. Such notions of embodied
% mathematics have–even before the Lakoff/Nuñez text–played a role in discussions
% of the development or instruction of mathematical ideas. The link between
% physical experience and mathematical growth was a strong element, for instance,
% in Montessori's work (see, e.g., \cite{hainstock1978essential}); much of the
% motivation behind traditional mathematical ``manipulatives'' such as number rods
% and balance beams can also be traced to this intellectual tradition. More
% recently, theoretical discussions of embodied cognition have given rise to
% fine-grained observations of the connections between bodily activity and

% software are made more expressive or powerful in future iterations.

%From IDC 2014 on paper-based electronics
% Having shown several representative prototypes of our own work in paper

% These last efforts are powerful examples of expanding techniques--they signal
% the emergence of a new territory within which to explore paper-based electronics.
% Our own prototypes are intended to continue this communal development of
% techniques and examples, but there are several factors that distinguish our work
% from that of other efforts. First, several of our own prototypes (e.g., PopCAD,
% the bicycle rider, and the cherry blossom painting) may be seen as incorporating
% paper elements as portions of larger, composite systems. PopCAD is a paper-based
% input device; one might think of it as one early foothold in an unexplored
% landscape of paper input devices for children's activities. The bicycle rider is
% an artifact that combines a desktop computer screen with a paper model; again,
% one could think of it as an exemplar of blending papercrafts with (e.g.)
% high-resolution graphics, or one could imagine websites designed to work as
% ``background graphics'' for electronically-controlled paper constructions. The
% cherry blossom painting is (in a sense) the ``flip side'' of PopCAD; whereas
% PopCAD is a paper-based input device, the cherry blossom painting is a
% paper-based display for output. And once more, one could take the example still
% further: paper mechanisms or models could be moved or controlled as components
% of extended output displays that combine physical and screen-based elements.

% More generally, we see our prototypes as (still-early) pointers toward a new
% genre of activities for children. In the final section, we turn our attention to
% the mechatronic future of children's papercrafts.
