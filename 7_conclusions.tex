\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

During the four years since beginning work on the first UCube prototype, our
thoughts and beliefs about the nature of our work evolved, became steadily more
focused and resulted in the work we present here on devices for embodied
fabrication. Over the course of three devices and three user studies, we gained
valuable insight into how young people think about 3D modeling, how they
interact with never-before-seen tangible devices, the kinds of models they
create, and the strategies they use (both verbal and gestural) to explain their
modeling decisions. This chapter is devoted to ``taking a look back'' at the
body of work that comprises this thesis and attempting to distill the most
relevant and unique findings into their most basic parts.
